# Kuhmilch - A Simple [Battlesnake](http://play.battlesnake.com) Written in Python

This is a basic implementation of the [Battlesnake API](https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/api) initially forked from https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/starter-snake-python on March 29th 2021.

## Requirements
All python requirements can be found in requirements.txt. Training the snakes locally will require a copy of the game engine. A precompiled release can be found [here](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/rules/releases). At the time of writing this I am using v1.0.17. Please download it to the training/engine folder.
